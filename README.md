# Mail Filter

  A website that helps us to maintain a clean inbox by filtering out unwanted mails in our Gmail Inbox. Gmail REST API was used to establish authorized access to user’s Gmail data. The website allows us to move or delete emails that are grouped by their mail id’s. PostgreSQL is used to store the mail ids and their frequency’s. The website is developed using Django, a python-based web framework.
